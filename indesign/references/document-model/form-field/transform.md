# transform

> **transform**( CoordinateSpaces **in**, Mixed **from**, Mixed **withMatrix**, Mixed **replacingCurrent**, Boolean **consideringRulerUnits** )
>
> Applies a transform to the page item.

### Parameters

| Type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CoordinateSpaces | in | Coordinate space used for the operation |
| Mixed | from | Temporary origin for the transformation. Accepts: Array of 2 Reals, AnchorPoint enumerator or Array of Arrays of 2 Reals, CoordinateSpaces enumerators, AnchorPoint enumerators, BoundingBoxLimits enumerators or Long Integers. |
| Mixed | withMatrix | Matrix used for the transform. Accepts: Array of 6 Reals or TransformationMatrix. |
| Mixed | replacingCurrent | Transform components selected for replacement; when this optional argument is supplied, those existing components on the target are overwritten with the new values. If it is omitted, the provided matrix is concatenated with the target's current transform so both effects combine. Accepts: MatrixContent enumerator, Array of MatrixContent enumerators or Long Integer. (Optional) |
| Boolean | consideringRulerUnits | When true, a ruler-based origin is read in ruler units instead of points. The default value is false. This matters only when the reference point is page-relative. (Optional) |
