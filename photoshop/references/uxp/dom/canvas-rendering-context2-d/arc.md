| y | `number` |  | The vertical coordinate of the arc's center. |
| radius | `number` |  | The arc's radius. Must be positive. |
| startAngle | `number` |  | The angle at which the arc starts in radians, measured from the positive x-axis. |
| endAngle | `number` |  | The angle at which the arc ends in radians, measured from the positive x-axis. |
| counterclockwise | `boolean` | `false` | An optional boolean value. If true, draws the arc counter-clockwise between the start and end angles. The default is false (clockwise). |
